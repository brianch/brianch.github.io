### Hello ðŸ‘‹

For the last few years I've been specially interested in **Rust**, and before that my favorite language was Pascal, I've worked in a couple open source **Lazarus/FreePascal** projects, and it still interests me.

My professional programming experience was with Java, but after so many years I don't recall much about that language (it changed a lot anyway), in that job I also did a bit of **frontend** work and I try to keep myself at least a bit up to date in this area.

In 2023 I graduated in Visual Arts, and you can see a few of my works in that area in [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/brianch).

I'm a big **FOSS** enthusiast, so I've been a GNU/Linux user for years and both in programming and in arts I use only Free and Open Source softwares.
